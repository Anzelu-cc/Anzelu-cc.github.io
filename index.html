      <h2>Schizophrenia</h2>
      <p>Schizophrenia is a mental health disorder that affects somehow and how they think, feel, and act. Some symptoms that come are hallucinations, delusions, confused thinking, and overall having a hard time going day by day. Even with all the stereotypes around schizophrenia, it's not the same as having "split personality," they are both two different things that should be separated but taken equally as seriously.</p>

      <h2>Mistakes when seeing schizophrenia</h2>
      <ul>
        <li></strong> "People with schizophrenia are violent."<br><em>Truth:</em> Most people with schizophrenia aren't violent but are actually more likely to be a victim from violence than actually committing it.</li>
        <li></strong> "People with schizophrenia have multiple personalities."<br><em>Truth:</em> This is just completely wrong. The reason so many get this wrong is because it comes from Dissociative Identity Disorder, but that's something different entirely.</li>
        <li></strong> "Schizophrenia is something that can't be treated."<br><em>Truth:</em> Surprisingly, even though what people think if someone with schizophrenia, was given the right treatment, they'd be able to continue on with their lives normally.</li>
      </ul>
